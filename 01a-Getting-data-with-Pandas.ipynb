    "## ♦ Grabbing static text files with `Pandas`\n",
    "While once much more common, a number of agencies still provide access to data as raw text files served up on a web server. Some examples are [USGS Water Use Data](https://water.usgs.gov/watuse/data/2010/index.html), and [NWIS Stream Flow data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nc/nwis/water_use?format=rdb&rdb_compression=value&wu_area=County&wu_year=ALL&wu_county=ALL&wu_category=IN&wu_county_nms=--ALL%2BCounties--&wu_category_nms=Industrial). If you've ever used these data in your projects, you know it's fairly easy to manage: just download the link to the file (if a download link is provided), or justcopy and paste. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if you have a lot of files to download, or if, like the stream gage data, you need to download it in real-time for your reseach, you can write a script to do this. Turns out it's note even that hard, thanks to the `pandas` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how `pandas` can read a text file from the web just as easily as a text file located on our local machine. We just substitute the data's web address (i.e., its URL) where we'd put the filename in using the `read_csv` function. It's that easy, but it only works if the data being served remotely is a raw text file...\n",
